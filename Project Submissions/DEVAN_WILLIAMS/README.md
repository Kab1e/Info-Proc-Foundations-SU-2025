The files within this project were configured/designed with the JupterLab environment in mind. Both, StardewValleyViz.ipynb and Stardew_Valley_Crops.csv should be uploaded into the same directory within the JupterLab environment.

Instructions for installing the bqplot library which is used within this project can be found at https://bqplot.github.io/bqplot/installation/

StardewValleyViz.ipynb is the Jupyter Notebook which contains code for the data visualization program.

Stardew_Valley_Crops.csv is read into a dataframe within the above file. This CSV was converted from an Excel spreadsheet.

For running the program, simply run all cells within StardewValleyViz.ipynb
